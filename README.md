# This file is written in vim

There are a lot of IDE came across my life. It causes me confuse which one should be used. Therefore, I searched for a universal acceptable Editor.
Thinking on benefit of a universal Tool, it could not be powerful as specialize one for each task, but it helps to save a ton of disk space and not force me to choose.
It likes if I need to bring pencil, I will pick common one instead of a bunch. So vim is my final option. It is light, extendable and universal. For most, I likes it mechanism.

But the default vim is not good option for a developer like me. If writing, I want to have some fancy support tool. Vim is, surprisingly, adaptable most of my demand. So, I will need to study a bit about vim, read some extra document and event source code (it is pretty small for sure). Then learning vim script and giving lots of effort on Internet or myself for upgrading default into fancy IDE. I think it is possible. Finally, storing my configure to cloud or somewhere else so I could load it into new vim when changing device.

For moving me Vim IDE to reality, gradually, I will update my script and configuration into this repository (maybe also document - who know).
