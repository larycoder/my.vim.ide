# Just extra convenient when coding

1. For folding:

```
set foldmethod=syntax
set foldcolumn=1
```

It will work well with vim-polyglot plugin so do not worry.
Then here are some convenient folding command:

- zR : open all fold of file
- zc : close fold
- zC : close all sub-fold of current fold
- zo : open fold
- zO : open all sub-fold of current fold

2. For autocomplete brace, using plugin search fast on internet:

```
Plug 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'
```

Fast test look good for me !
