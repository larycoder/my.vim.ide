# You already about search on IDE ?

I do not work too much with search in IDE, but having same one will be better.
Fuzzy search "fzf" is best choice on fast search internet. Let install it:

```
pacman -S fzf
pacman -S ripgrep       => very interesting file search tool
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim' => add this to vim-plug
```

Then try to read manual to play with it, if you like some blog, here is good:
