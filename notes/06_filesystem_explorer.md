# Explore your file

It is actually not necessary to have a explorer for coding. But if wanting
to look at file system during coding time, it is just wonderful.

# Plugin

Again, fast search Internet, NERDtree is good plugin for it. So let config it.

# Download by plug-vim:

```vimL
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
```

# Quick setup

Just map command to shortcut "Crt-B" so it look very like Vscode (Tres Bien)

```vimL
map <C-B> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
```
