# List of useful information can be show in corner of vim

Following some fancy website about vim, I have this:

```
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
```

Very worst to install it for looking useful status, It status is a bit colorful for me, I will deal with it later ;-)

# List buffer

Tired of ":ls" commend every times, solution:

```
Plug 'bling/vim-bufferline'
```

Just installed it, present a bit messy and somehow have bad compatible with vim-airline, but it is fantasy for small amount of buffer
For large one, maybe you should use ":ls" --> note: buffer number is always increasing event if you totally delete buffer, accept it.
