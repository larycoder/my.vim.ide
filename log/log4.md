# Finish most of fancy update for default vim, next step:

- Check out all plugin and rewrite it by hand --> double joke --> do not try it at home (at least for now)
- Thinking on wrap all setup into single package for fast deploying when changing laptop (hint: install bash script could be good choice)

# Some thing for update:

- Try to open terminal as NERDTree (now, term is open very bad position and not cross-tab --> I do not like it) => I accept it now so remove this.
- Add extra info bottom corner screen of vim to monitor                                   --> done it.
