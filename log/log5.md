# setup script is good, but need to improve

Firstly, I think I will not continue this project for a bit long (too overload now), so just simple requirement for me when coming back to project in future:

- Update README for using setup script
- Note: setup script have series problem with vim exec order and delay (hint: learn to use vim script for synchronous process).
