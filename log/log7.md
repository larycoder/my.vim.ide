# Short comeback (2022-12-10)

OK, I really happy with my installation script. It work pretty well. But there
are some notice for neovim:

1. For properly enable theme, remember to re-configure "colors_cfg.vim" file. I
do not remember why I disable it but maybe there are some unaware bug in there
=))

2. I will re-update README for configuration path of neovim, I do not properly
remember about that.
