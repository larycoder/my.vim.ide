# What do you NOT like in default VIM:
- auto indent bad               -> Look good for now
- not have completion           -> Now having one
- not have reformat             -> There are plan for it
- bad color highlight           -> Syntax wonderful now

# OK, next jobs:

1. Searching about Vim plugin mechanism (including vim manager)
2. Find some plugin to kill above hater thing

# Hint for beautify code:

- Find some code formatting program to do that and integrate to vim. Maybe someone already do that ;)
