# What do you NOT like in default VIM:
- auto indent bad
- not have completion
- not have reformat
- bad color highlight

# OK, next jobs:

1. Searching about Vim plugin mechanism (including vim manager)
2. Find some plugin to kill above hater thing

# Hint for beautify code:

- Find some code formatting program to do that and integrate to vim. Maybe someone already do that ;)
